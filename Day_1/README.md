**Objective:**
The goal of this task is to develop a foundational understanding of database design by creating a well-structured relational database schema. This involves identifying relevant entities, defining their attributes, establishing relationships, and implementing the schema using SQL.

**Description:**
In this task, students will select a domain of their choiceâ€”such as a Library Management System translate it into a relational database model. They will begin by analyzing the chosen domain to identify the main entities (e.g., Customers, Orders, Books), their attributes (e.g., Name, Email, OrderDate), and the relationships between them (e.g., One-to-Many, Many-to-Many).

Using a database management tool such as MySQL Workbench, pgAdmin, or SQLiteStudio, students will create an SQL script that defines the database schema. This includes writing CREATE TABLE statements, defining primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints to maintain data integrity.

An ER (Entity-Relationship) diagram will also be created to visually represent the structure of the database and illustrate how the entities are connected.

**Deliverables:**

An SQL script that creates the database schema

An ER diagram that clearly shows all entities, attributes, and relationships

**Tools:**

MySQL Workbench 

**Expected Outcome:**
By completing this task, students will gain hands-on experience in designing normalized databases and writing SQL for schema creation. The final result should be a well-organized and relational database schema that could serve as the backbone of a software application.
